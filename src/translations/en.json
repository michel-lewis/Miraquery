      {
        "question": "What is MiraQuery?",
        "answer": "MiraQuery is a TypeScript backend engine that transforms your natural language queries into executable SQL or MongoDB commands. It uses xAI's Grok API to understand and generate these queries, simplifying access and analysis of your data for everyone."
      },
      {
        "question": "Which databases does MiraQuery support?",
        "answer": "Currently, MiraQuery supports PostgreSQL and MongoDB. We use official and lightweight drivers for these two databases, with schema introspection to ensure generated queries are precise and adapted to your data structure."
      },
      {
        "question": "What AI technology does MiraQuery use?",
        "answer": "MiraQuery relies exclusively on xAI's Grok API for artificial intelligence. This allows us to delegate computational load and benefit from Grok's advanced capabilities for precise natural language to query conversion."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is MiraQuery fast?",
        "answer": "Yes, MiraQuery is designed for performance. Thanks to a Redis cache (ioredis), results from frequent queries are served in less than 50 ms. Additionally, connection pools managed by underlying Node.js drivers help reduce latency."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does MiraQuery ensure security and robustness?",
        "answer": "MiraQuery is built on a 100% TypeScript stack, ensuring robustness and strict typing. We use Zod for typed and secure input validation, and NeverThrow for robust and predictable error management."
      },
      {
        "question": "How can I integrate MiraQuery into my application?",
        "answer": "MiraQuery offers several integration options: a powerful REST API (POST /query route), an npm package @korva/mira (client-side SDK) to simplify API calls, and Swagger/OpenAPI documentation with an interactive UI interface (/docs) to facilitate testing and API exploration."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I deploy MiraQuery on my own servers (On-Premise)?",
        "answer": "Absolutely! In addition to the SaaS platform and API service, MiraQuery offers a containerized version via Docker (with Helm charts) for companies with strict security and compliance requirements."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is there a free version of MiraQuery?",
        "answer": "Yes, we offer a Freemium tier that allows you to perform up to 50 queries per month for free. This gives you the opportunity to test MiraQuery and discover its power before upgrading to a paid plan."
      },
      {
        "question": "What future features are planned for MiraQuery?",
        "answer": "We plan a data warehouse for analytical queries, an integrated chatbot (Slack, Teams, WhatsApp), integration of vector databases (e.g., Milvus), a Model Context Protocol (MCP), custom prompts, query pipelines, and monitoring tools with intelligent recommendations."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does MiraQuery differ from other Text2SQL tools?",
        "answer": "MiraQuery stands out with its versatility (SQL and NoSQL), developer-oriented approach (TypeScript stack, npm SDK, Swagger), superior performance thanks to Redis cache, and robust architecture. Our ecosystem vision with ambitious future plans (DW, chatbot, vector bases) makes it a complete and scalable solution."
